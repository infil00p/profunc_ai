# Profunc Next Generation

These are some scripts I generated real quick so I can navigate my 4 GB of PDF data that I collected for four years on the RCMP and CSIS with
respect to the 2010 Winter Olympic Games and the G8/G20 Summit in Toronto.  This is some very basic Retrieval Augmented Generation work, and 
I'm sure I can modify this to provide insights into other documents.

The most computationally expensive task is cleaning the data.

## OK, WHAT IS THIS?

This is the future of Data Driven Journalism.  Have you ever wanted an LLM that was tuned on a bunch of ATIP data from the Canadian Government
and you can ask it questions and get the most unhinged as hell responses from it?
