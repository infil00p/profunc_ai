# Profunc Next Generation

This is the Canadian Surveillance LLM.  These are the tools that I'm currently using to scan in all the PDFs that I received from the RCMP
between 2010 and 2014 when working on Paroxysms.ca and profunc.ca.

## OK, WHAT IS THIS?

This is the future of Data Driven Journalism.  Have you ever wanted an LLM that was tuned on a bunch of ATIP data from the Canadian Government
and you can ask it questions and get the most unhinged as hell responses from it?
